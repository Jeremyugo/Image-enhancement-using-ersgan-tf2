## Image-enhancement-using-esrgan-tf2

This repository contains a deep learning project that uses a pre-trained Enhanced Super Resolution GAN (esrgan-tf2) model to improve the resolution of images. <br/>
The real world applications of this technique include:

- Forensic Analysis: It helps forensic experts extract and analyze fine details from crime scene photos, surveillance footage, or digital images, aiding in evidence collection and crime reconstruction.

- Art Restoration: allows experts to capture fine details of deteriorated artwork, digitally reconstruct missing parts, and analyze pigments, enabling accurate restoration and conservation efforts.

- Industrial quality control: It enables precise defect detection, measurement, and analysis, improving product quality and reducing manufacturing errors.

- Astronomy and Astrophysics: Enables the observation of distant galaxies, star formations, and planetary surfaces, enhancing our understanding of the universe.


#### Packages used for this project include:
- PIL
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Matplotlib
